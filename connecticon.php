						  <h1>About Connecticon</h1>
						  <p>
							  Connecticon is an open source project that attempts at reproducing Facebook. The purpose of this application was to enable me to apply the knowledge I acquired whilst learning the ins and out of the Laravel 5 framework. At this stage of the project, I can clearly say that the main objectives where achieved. These include
							   <ul>
							   	<li>✦ Establishing database connection</li>
							   	<li>✦ Creating a new profile</li>
							   	<li>✦ Sign in functionality</li>
							   	<li>✦ Functional Dashboard</li>
							   	<li>✦ Ability to modify profile information</li>
							   </ul>

						  <h1>Making the layout responsive</h1>
						  <p>The application was designed following the mobile first approach. This therefore enabled me to identify a list of items that should be seen first as this methodology follows a linear pattern. This will ensure that the website is user friendly at different viewport sizes.</p>
						  <h1>Initial Wireframes</h1>
						  <p>The following wireframes represent the intial wireframes designed using Sketch. These served as a visual guideline to center the focus purely on user interaction elements.</p>
						  
						  <h2>Mobile wireframe</h2>
						  <img src="img/connecticonWireframeMobile.svg" class="wireframe-mobile center-image">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe represents the mobile interface of the application. Emphasis was put into enabling all of the form elements such as textboxes and buttons to be used easily with touch screen devices. </p>
						  
						  <h2>Desktop wireframe</h2>

						  <img src="img/connecticonWireframeDesktop.svg" class="wireframe-desktop center-image">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe on the other hand represents the desktop interface of the application. Element in this case were placed in order to efficiently utilise the available space in this widder viewport</p>
						  
						  <h1>Layout tools utilised</h1>
						  <p>
						  	The Bootstrap framework was utilised as the interface layout tool due to three major factors.
						  	<ul>
						  		<li><strong>I.</strong> Simplicity of its application</li>
						  		<li><strong>II.</strong> Solid layout system</li>
						  		<li><strong>III.</strong> Easily maintainable</li>
						  	</ul>

						  </p>	
						  <h1>Application use cases</h1>  
						  <p>Here you can find the complete front-end view of the application based on the design requirements set earlier.</p>
