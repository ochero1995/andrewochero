						  <h1>About Target Animation</h1>
						  <p>
							  Target animation is a web application designed as platform where SVG artists from all sorts of different backgrounds can share and distribute their design elements with the world. Interaction between subscribed users is done via the dedicated forum. In the early stages however, the owner of the application failed in designing an efficient and responsive layout for the application mainly due to the lack of resources he had available to deliver the project. Therefore, he decided to hire me for this project as the front-end developer. The main goals of the layout design was to ensure that it is:
							   	<ul>
							   		<li>✦Responsive</li>
							   		<li>✦Easy to navigate through</li>
							   		<li>✦Able to showcase all of the artwork efficiently</li>
							   		<li>✦Visually atractive whiles maintaining its overall efficiency</li>
							   	</ul>

						  <h1>Making the layout responsive</h1>
						  <p>The application was designed following the mobile first approach. This therefore enabled me to identify a list of items that should be seen first as this methodology follows a linear pattern. This will ensure that the website is user friendly at different viewport sizes.</p>
						  <h1>Initial Wireframes</h1>
						  <p>The following wireframes represent the intial wireframes presented by the client. These served as a visual guideline to center the focus purely on user interaction elements.</p>
						  
						  <h2>Mobile view</h2>
						  <img src="img/connecticonWireframeMobile.svg" class="wireframe-mobile center-image">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe represents the mobile interface of the application. Emphasis was put into enabling all of the form elements such as textboxes and buttons to be used easily with touch screen devices. </p>
						  
						  <h2>Desktop view</h2>

						  <img src="img/connecticonWireframeDesktop.svg" class="wireframe-desktop center-image">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe on the other hand represents the desktop interface of the application. Elements in this case were placed in order to efficiently utilise the available space in this widder viewport</p>
						  
						  <h1>Layout tools utilised</h1>
						  <p>
						  	The Bootstrap framework was utilised as the interface layout tool due to three major factors.
						  	<ul>
						  		<li><strong>I.</strong> Simplicity of its application</li>
						  		<li><strong>II.</strong> Solid layout system</li>
						  		<li><strong>III.</strong> Easily maintainable</li>
						  	</ul>
