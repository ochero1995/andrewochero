						  <h1>About JumpCon</h1>
						  <p>
							  The main objective of this web application is to allow fans of Shonen Jump magasin to attend the annual JumpCon conference. Therefore, the event handlers approached me in order to develop a website in view of the upcoming JumpCon 2016 conference. The following set of requirments were set by the client and later on implemented to the final application. 
							   <ul>
							   	<li>✦ Single page layout</li>
							   	<li>✦ Landing page</li>
							   	<li>✦ Straight forward sign up forms</li>
							   	<li>✦ Main guests section</li>
							   	<li>✦ Timetable</li>
							   </ul>
						   </p>

						  <h1>Making the layout responsive</h1>
						  <p>The application was designed following the mobile first approach. This therefore enabled me to identify a list of items that should be seen first as this methodology follows a linear pattern. This will ensure that the website is user friendly at different viewport sizes.</p>
						  <h1>Initial Wireframes</h1>
						  <p>The following wireframes were handed over to me by the event handlers as a visual representation of what the final product should look like.</p>
						  
						  <h2>Mobile</h2>
						  <img src="img/jumpconwireframeMobile.svg" class="wireframe-mobile center-image">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe represents the mobile interface of the application.</p>
						  
						  <h2>Desktop</h2>

						  <img src="img/jumpconwireframeDesktop.svg" class="wireframe-desktop">
						  
						  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This wireframe on the other hand represents the desktop interface of the application.</p>
						  
						  <h1>Layout tools utilised</h1>
						  <p>
						  	The Bootstrap framework was utilised as the interface layout tool due to three major factors.
						  	<ul>
						  		<li><strong>I.</strong> Simplicity of its application</li>
						  		<li><strong>II.</strong> Solid layout system</li>
						  		<li><strong>III.</strong> Easily maintainable</li>
						  	</ul>

						  </p>	
						  <h1>Application use cases</h1>  
						  <p>Here you can find a few screenshots of the working application. Design aspects such as color schemes are still subject to change based on the client's requirements.</p>
